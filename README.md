# Erltrek: Star Trek Game in Erlang

* License: BSD 3-clause

## Goals

* Incorporating true concurrency (= game proceeds in real-time)
* Not altering the traditional Star Trek model
    * Coordinate system: 2D and dual layer (Quadrants + Sectors)
    * Weapons: phaser and torpedo
    * Not too fast but not too slow
